libgenerics
-----------

libgenerics is a minimalistic and generic library for C basic data structures.

The entire implementation was aimed at providing reusable, generic and easy-to-read code like this:

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <generics/queue.h>

#define N 10

int main()
{
	int i;
	queue_t q;
	queue_create(&q, sizeof(int));

	for( i=0; i<N; i++ )
		queue_enqueue(&q, &i);

	int temp;
	for( i=0; i<N/2; i++ ){
		queue_dequeue(&q, &temp);
		printf("dequeued: %d\n", temp);
	}

	queue_destroy(&q);
	return 0;
}
```

The [doxygen](http://doxygen.org/) documentation is available [here](https://github.com/yudi-matsuzake/libgenerics/blob/master/doc/doc.pdf). There's only the pdf version pre-generated, but you can generate the html and the man format with [doxygen](http://doxygen.org/).

Installation
------------

```shell
$ make
$ sudo make install
```

To make sure everything went well you may compile the examples:

```
$ make examples
```

You can copy the code above to a file name `main.c` and compile after the installation using:

```shell
$ gcc main.c -lgenerics
```
